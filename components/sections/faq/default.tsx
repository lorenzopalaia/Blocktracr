                In today&apos;s AI-driven world, standing out is harder than
                ever. While anyone can build a product, a professional landing
                page makes the difference between success and failure.

              Why use Launch UI instead of a no-code tool?

                No-code tools lock you into their ecosystem with recurring fees
                and limited control. They often come with performance issues and
                make it difficult to integrate with your product.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 max-w-[600px] text-muted-foreground">
                You can&apos;t even change your hosting provider and basic
                things like web analytics come as extra costs and paid add-ons.

                What might seem like a convenient solution today could paint you
                into a corner tomorrow, limiting your ability to scale and
                adapt. Launch UI gives you full control of your code while
                maintaining professional quality.

              How Launch UI is different from other components libraries and
              templates?

            <AccordionContent>
              <p className="mb-4 max-w-[580px] text-muted-foreground">
                Launch UI stands out with premium design quality and delightful
                touches of custom animations and illustrations.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 max-w-[580px] text-muted-foreground">
                All components are carefully crafted to help position your
                product as a professional tool, avoiding the generic template
                look.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 max-w-[640px] text-balance text-muted-foreground">
                Unlike many libraries that rely on outdated CSS practices and
                old dependencies, Launch UI is built with modern technologies
                and best practices in mind.

                The pro version that contains more components and options is a
                one-time purchase that gives you lifetime access to all current
